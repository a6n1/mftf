mftf.exe v. 2.1 by Ignacio J. Perez J.
The tool can parse the $MFT from a live system, from a mounted (read-only
included) logical drive or from a copy of the $MFT.
It can search for folders, files and ADS,s by parsing the $MFT. It shows the
sizes and SI and FN datetimes.
It can copy files or ADS,s using the references provided in the results.
The copy is made by reading the data from the clusters so that you can copy
protected system files or files in use.

==== Main options:
 -d drive_letter               Search/copy files from this logical unit.
 -o file                       Search files from this offline $MFT file.
 -h                            This help.
==== String search:
 -f "string1[|string2 with spaces|string3?...]"
 -f "\folder\string"         \ at the beginning means from the root folder
 -f "folder1\folder2\string"
                          The results will be filtered by the folders tree.
                          The match is always case insensitive.
                          " as delimiters for the whole group of strings.
                          | is the separator.
                          ? at the end of any string for an exact coincidence
 -ff file.txt      The strings to search for are in file.txt. One string per
                    line. Can use ?.
 -fr string        Search in the 1024 bytes of the MFT record.
==== Directory search:
 -fd "\Dir1\dir2"          Search under tree: "\Dir1\dir2...\"
 -fd "\Dir1\dir2\"         Can use ? with the last directory or end with \.
 -r N                        Recursion level (number). Default is 0.

 -t               Display the results in timeline format.
 -s               Display only the file name.
==== Information options:
 -i record_number      Show information of the MFT record.
 -w record_number      Write on screen the 1024 bytes of the MFT record.

 -c "ref1[|ref2..]"  Copy the referenced file/s to this folder.
                                     Use | as separator.

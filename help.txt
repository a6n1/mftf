mftf.exe v.2.4.1
Fast MFT timeliner and searcher.
The tool can parse the $MFT from a live system, from a mounted (read-only
included) logical drive or from a copy of the $MFT.
Deleted files and folders have their path with the prefix "?".
It can copy files or ADS,s using the references provided in the results.
The copy is made by reading the data from the clusters so that you can copy
protected system files or files in use.
